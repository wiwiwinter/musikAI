# MusikAI

MusikAI is an AI-powered music recommendation system that detects a user's mood through facial expressions and suggests music accordingly. The system leverages deep learning models to analyze facial expressions and map them to emotional states, which are then used to recommend suitable music tracks.

## Features
- **Facial Emotion Detection**: Uses a neural network to classify emotions from facial expressions.
- **Music Recommendation**: Suggests songs based on the detected mood using predefined mood profiles.
- **User Preferences**: Customizable mood-based recommendations tailored to individual users.
- **Deep Learning Integration**: Implements a VGG-based neural network for emotion recognition.
- **Logging and Debugging**: Generates logs for monitoring application performance and debugging issues.
